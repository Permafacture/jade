============


Once jade is installed, all interaction takes place from the entry point ``jade``:

.. code-block:: bash

    ~$ jade -h


You can also reference the entry point using the ``python -m jade`` syntax. There are several subcommands you can use with jade, all of which are explained in detail below.


.. Note:: If you are developing within jade and would like to test out any of the entry points, you can access the entry point without installing the repository by:

    .. code-block:: bash

        cd ~/jade
        python -m jade -h
